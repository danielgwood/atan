- Fully update Controller to take the new details from V13.
- Update ObjName classes to take additional information
- Change parser to reflect all this. (The parsing bit is already done, the info just needs to be passed to the correct methods via parameters.
- Implement coaches and trainers (This involves having a seperate parser for each)

All this has already been implemented within my university project, however transferring it across will take some work. I plan to do all this in stages, keeping track of my progress within these todo and changelog text files. I am hoping to have Atan fully updraded and functional to SServer V13 by the summer.

Note: I am well aware SServer v14 is out already, which adds new functionality like red/yellow cards. However, as this is such a mojor change to SServer I am leaving this well alone for now. My university project is only to V13, so that is all I am going to make Atan for now. Once the project is over, I shall continue working on Atan, then updating it to V14. As Atan now specifies the SServer version it expects in the init command, Atan can be used with any new version of the SServer, as SServer automatically translates to previous versions.
